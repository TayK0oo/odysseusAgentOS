"""Tests for advisory routing (M3.1, retargeted to NATIVE roles).

After the native-capability mapping (.planning/intel/INDEX.md), the grafted
ModelRouter was verdict REDUNDANT (phantom catalog, no dispatch call-site). The
advisory now suggests a NATIVE role (default/utility/research/vision) that the
native resolve_endpoint already understands — no phantom model catalog.
