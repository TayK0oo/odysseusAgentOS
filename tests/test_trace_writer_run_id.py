"""M3.X slice 1 — per-run correlation id in trace_writer.

Before this slice, `run_id` was a process-level constant (one UUID for the
whole process lifetime), so traces from different runs/turns could not be
correlated. These tests pin the new per-run behaviour: a run scope can be
opened with a fresh id, `write_trace` records the *current* id, and the
default (no scope opened) stays backward-compatible with the process id.
