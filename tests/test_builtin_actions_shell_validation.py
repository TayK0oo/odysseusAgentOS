"""M3.4 — command-validation must cover the run_script/run_local shell bypasses.

action_ssh_command already runs the command_validator (Phase 12), but
action_run_script / action_run_local reached _run_subprocess with no
validation at all — a scheduled task could execute `rm -rf /` unchecked.
These tests pin that both action entrypoints block a destructive script
BEFORE spawning a subprocess, and still let benign scripts through.
