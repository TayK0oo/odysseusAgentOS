"""M3.5 (safe slice) — drop the redundant ChannelType.EMAIL/WEBHOOK arms.

Cartography verdict: the EMAIL/WEBHOOK enum members duplicate mature native
subsystems (email pollers + webhook_manager) and have zero code callers — no
adapter is ever registered for them, so gateway.send() never delivered via
them. These tests pin that only the two real in-process channels remain and
that the send route degrades gracefully on an unknown channel string.
