"""Canonical 7-phase loop definitions (Milestone 2, design Section 2).

Each canonical phase maps to a phase-lock enforcement name (a key in
config/phase-lock.yaml) and a set of "forced" tools the loop should encourage
in that phase. The enforcement itself lives in src/tool_registry.py; this module
is pure data + helpers.
