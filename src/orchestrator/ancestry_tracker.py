"""ancestry_tracker — kill-switched bridge that makes governance ancestry live (M3.4).

The native GovernanceManager.create_task_with_ancestry() builds a full
mission>goal>project>task ancestry path, but the live loop (stream_agent_loop)
never called it — ancestry was a route-only feature. This module lets the loop
record a run's ancestry at MEMORY_OBSERVE through one shared, kill-switched call
site (same shape as phase_tracker.py).

SAFETY: OFF by default (ODYSSEUS_GOVERNANCE_ANCESTRY). When OFF, or when the run
has no orchestrated goal context (no project_id), nothing is written and live
behaviour is unchanged. When ON and a project_id is present, one GoalTask with
its ancestry_path is created via the native manager. Best-effort: any fault is
swallowed so it can never break the loop.
