"""channel_bootstrap.py — wake the dormant Discord/Telegram adapters (M3.5).

The Discord/Telegram adapters (src/adapters/*) and the ChannelGateway
(src/channel_gateway.py) already exist but have zero in-process callers, so the
gateway never runs live. This module is the single, kill-switched wake-up point
that `_startup_event` calls:

    - inbound  : adapter -> gateway inbound handler -> event_bus.fire_event(...)
    - outbound : OutboundMessage -> gateway.send(...) (native delivery)

SAFETY: each channel is OFF by default behind its own kill-switch
(ODYSSEUS_INPROCESS_DISCORD / ODYSSEUS_INPROCESS_TELEGRAM), mirroring
src/orchestrator/phase_tracker.tracker_enabled(). With both OFF (the default),
bootstrap_channels() registers nothing and starts nothing, so startup behaviour
is byte-identical to today. Everything here is best-effort: a broken adapter,
bus, or bot can never crash the app.
