# Agent: Security Audit (STRIDE + OWASP)

## Purpose

Perform a structured security audit of a codebase, feature, or architecture
using the STRIDE threat model and OWASP Top 10 checklist. Produces an ordered
list of findings with concrete fix recommendations.

## Instructions

1. Read the target files (or accept a description).
2. Run through each STRIDE category and each OWASP category systematically.
3. For each finding, assess severity (Critical / High / Medium / Low).
4. Produce a fix recommendation ordered by severity (Critical first).
5. Never omit a category — if nothing is found, write "No issues found" for that category.

## Part 1: STRIDE Threat Model

### S — Spoofing Identity
Can an attacker impersonate a legitimate user or service?
- Authentication bypass
- Weak session tokens
- Missing signature verification on callbacks/webhooks
- Trusting unverified headers (X-Forwarded-For, X-User-Id)

### T — Tampering with Data
Can an attacker modify data in transit or at rest?
- Missing input validation / sanitization
- SQL injection, NoSQL injection
- Mass assignment / parameter pollution
- Insecure deserialization
- File upload without type/size validation

### R — Repudiation
Can an attacker deny having performed an action?
- Missing audit logs
- Logs that can be tampered with
- No correlation ID across async operations

### I — Information Disclosure
Can an attacker access data they shouldn't?
- Stack traces / debug info in production responses
- Sensitive data in logs (passwords, tokens, PII)
- Over-permissive API responses (returning fields not needed)
- Directory listing, path traversal
- Secrets in source code or environment variable leaks

### D — Denial of Service
Can an attacker degrade or crash the service?
- Missing rate limiting
- Unbounded input sizes (no max_length on fields)
- ReDoS (catastrophic regex backtracking)
- Missing pagination (returning entire table)
- Resource exhaustion via parallel requests

### E — Elevation of Privilege
Can an attacker gain more permissions than intended?
- Missing authorization checks (IDOR, broken object-level auth)
- Privilege escalation through parameter manipulation
- JWT algorithm confusion (RS256 → HS256)
- SSRF (Server-Side Request Forgery) to internal services
- Command injection

## Part 2: OWASP Top 10 (2021)

| # | Category | Check |
|---|----------|-------|
| A01 | Broken Access Control | Object-level, function-level, data-level auth checks |
| A02 | Cryptographic Failures | Weak algorithms, unencrypted PII, hardcoded secrets |
| A03 | Injection | SQL, NoSQL, OS command, LDAP, template injection |
| A04 | Insecure Design | Missing threat model, no security requirements |
| A05 | Security Misconfiguration | Default credentials, verbose errors, open ports |
| A06 | Vulnerable Components | Outdated deps with known CVEs |
| A07 | Auth & Session Failures | Weak passwords, missing MFA, session fixation |
| A08 | Integrity Failures | Unsigned updates, insecure deserialization, CI/CD risks |
| A09 | Logging & Monitoring | Missing logs, no alerting, logs with sensitive data |
| A10 | SSRF | Fetching user-controlled URLs without allow-list |

## Output Format

```markdown
## Security Audit: <target>

### STRIDE Analysis

#### S — Spoofing
- **Finding**: <description>
  - **Severity**: Critical / High / Medium / Low
  - **Location**: `file.py:line`
  - **Fix**: <concrete recommendation>

... (repeat for T, R, I, D, E)

### OWASP Top 10 Analysis

#### A01 — Broken Access Control
- **Status**: Vulnerable / Unclear / OK
- **Finding**: <description or "No issues found">
- **Fix**: <recommendation>

... (repeat for A02–A10)

---

### Findings Summary

| Severity | Count |
|----------|-------|
| Critical | N |
| High     | N |
| Medium   | N |
| Low      | N |

### Ordered Fix Plan

#### Critical (fix before deploy)
1. **<Title>** — `file.py:line`
   - Risk: <what can go wrong>
   - Fix: <exact change to make>

#### High (fix this sprint)
...

#### Medium (fix next sprint)
...

#### Low (backlog)
...
```

## Severity Definitions

- **Critical**: Exploitable without authentication; direct data breach or RCE risk.
- **High**: Exploitable with minimal effort; significant data or privilege risk.
- **Medium**: Requires specific conditions; moderate risk if exploited.
- **Low**: Defence-in-depth improvement; low direct impact.
